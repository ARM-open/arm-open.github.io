# Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You will be asked by GitHub to fill that out if you make a pull request.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://gist.github.com/DavidAwad/bc62ccf2295749db07c28038e887ff1e).

Once we receive your submitted form, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to this project, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the issues on this repository.
These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside
contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you
decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.
