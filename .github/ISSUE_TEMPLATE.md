NOTE: Only file GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests.  All other topics will be closed.

For general support from the community, see [StackOverflow](www.stackoverflow.com).
To make bugs and feature requests more easy to find and organize, we close issues that are deemed
out of scope for GitHub Issues and point people to StackOverflow.

For bugs or installation issues, please provide the following information.
The more information you provide, the more easily we will be able to offer
help and advice.

### What related GitHub issues or StackOverflow threads have you found by searching the web for your problem?

### If possible, provide a minimal reproducible example (We usually don't have time to read hundreds of lines of your code)


### What other attempted solutions have you tried?


### Logs or other output that would be helpful
(If logs are large, please upload as attachment or provide link).
